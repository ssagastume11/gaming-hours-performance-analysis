-- Objective:
-- The goal of this step is to clean, validate, and structure the gaming performance dataset so it is ready for accurate and reliable analysis. This includes ensuring correct data types, handling missing or inconsistent values, and creating a cleaned table that supports performance impact analysis.

-- Key Actions:
-- * Validate and enforce correct data types for numeric and categorical fields
-- * Handle null or missing values to prevent skewed results.
-- * Standarize categorical values for consistency.
-- * Create a cleaned version of the dataset for downstream analysis.

-- Objective:

-- The goal of this step is to clearly communicate insights about how gaming habits relate to academic and workplace performance.
-- This includes translating aggregated analysis results into meaningful visualizations and summaries that help stakeholders quickly understand performance patterns, behavioral trends, and potential impacts of gaming duration, timing, and lifestyle factors.

-- Key Actions:

-- * Create visualization-ready datasets that summarize performance outcomes by gaming behavior.
-- * Use comparative charts to highlight differences across performance categories, occupations, and gaming times.
-- * Emphasize relationships between gaming hours, sleep, stress, and focus, and productivity.
-- * Present findings in clear, non-technical language supported by visuals.
-- * Design outputs that are easily shareable through dashboards, presentations, and documentation.
-- * Ensure insights directly address the original business question regarding positive, negative, or neutral gaming impact.
